# Java-Library-GameEngine

Library GameEngine made in Java without additional libraries by Dominic Jiang

## Contributor List:

1. Dominic Jiang for the production of the library and library development

## How To Test This Library On Mac OS Or Windows

1. Download GameEngine.jar 

2. Make sure you have JVM downloaded if not find ways to download for your operating system

3. Open terminal and type java (space) -jar (space) and drag the executable jar file in and press enter 


4. And the algorithm should be ready to go

## Command Center

1. After pressing 1, by clicking on the screen can add new obstacles on the screen

2. After pressing 2, by clicking on the screen can remove obstacles on the screen

3. After pressing 3, by clicking on the screen can change the start position which is the red point

3. After pressing 4, by clicking on the screen can change the exit position which is the blue point

3. Type start and press enter, will start to calculate the shortest path to the exit which is from the red point to the blue point (This might take some time, if the puzzle is impossible to solve, it will stop the current calculation)

4. Type setResolution with the resolution you want after it, (Example: setResolution 100) can set the resolution

5. Type reset will reset all of the obstacles and stop the current calculation to the shortest path

6. Type exportMap will export the map to the directory you want it to be 

7. Type loadMap will load the map that you chosed

8. I wish you enjoy my algorithm and have a wonderful rest of your day
